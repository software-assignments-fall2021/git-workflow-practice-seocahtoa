This article is about how simple apps such as the calculator app can be deceiving to users as they can be utilized as a 'Stalkerware'. These so called "simple" apps typically spy on user by documenting what they type on their keyboards, web browser histories, text messages, and calls. These hidden features that are not so transparent with the users can be seemingly dangerous if they were to be exploited in a bad way. The articles mentions a few things that we could do to prevent unexpected tracking. By changing your passcode frequently and enable two-factor authentication when possible. It could drastically reduce the user's risk of getting spied on.

Privacy is very important to a lot of people, but I personally find myself not caring
about privacy as much as I should. Maybe it's because I like free stuff, and the less privacy
I have, the more free stuff I can get. Free of course meaning I don't pay in cash, not that 
my data is being sold off to some company to make me buy their product. But I do wish of a world where we all had privacy, but that world is sadly not the one we live in currently. Maybe
in the future we could, but we've got a long way to go.
